# Parse security saved searches from records

## Motivation

In many cases, there is a need for a bulk import of saved searches into a Splunk.
This application streamlines this process by reducing the creation of said searches
to only pushing data to a Splunk index/input lookup and then processing it with
this application.

## Description

The `gensecsavsearch` command takes records with specified columns and converts them into a saved searches. The most common usage is with a CSV-based lookup uploaded through [Splunk App for Lookup File Editing](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724).
**All searches saved within this app that are NOT present inside the CSV will be deleted upon execution of the command**.

The searches are saved to this application, so removing this application will also remove all searches generated by it.

## Example

With having a input lookup `stored_searches`, having columns:
- `name` (string, used as a key)
- `cron` (string, cron schedule for running the search)
- `enabled` (string, yes/no)
- `search` (string, the search to run)

```text
  | inputlookup stored_searches
  | gensecsavsearch
```

Or, with enabled verbose logging:

```text
  | inputlookup stored_searches
  | gensecsavsearch verbose=yes
```
